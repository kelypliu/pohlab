Dr. Poh's lab focuses on the development and application of screening and diagnostic strategies for early detection, risk assessment, and management of oral cancer and precancerous diseases. 

We are currently working on translating several molecular and imaging tests (both non-invasive and invasive) for triaging patients to appropriate clinical management according to their risk of cancer progression, as well as identifying and integrating prognostic markers of nodal diseases for oral cancer patients. 

Complementing benchtop research, the lab also collaborates on longitudinal and large-scale clinical studies for both precancerous and cancerous lesions, as well as establishing a population-based oral premalignant biobank through working with dental communities, the BC Oral Biopsy Service, and the clinic of Integrative Triage for Patients with Oral Pre-malignant Lesions.
