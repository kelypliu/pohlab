Oral cancer affects **everyone**, making it a pressing **global health challenge** not confined by by geoegraphy, age, or background. Each year, hundres of thousands of people worldwide are diagnosed, yet survival rates have remained unchanged for decades. 

At the Oral Cancer Discovery & Prevention Lab, we believe the future of oral cancer care lies in **early discovery, proactive prevention, and patient empowerment**. Our research spans the full spectrum of basic, translational, and clinical science - from uncovering molecular signatures of early disease, to developing innovative clinical tools and biomarker-based targets, to advancing screening and prevention strategies.

We work at the interaction of **molecular biology, clinical oncology, imaging, and computational sciecne**, driven by a simple goal: to translate laboratory discoveries into real-world impact that improves survival, enahnces quality of life, and reduces the burden of disease across communities. 

Based at the **University of British Columbia** and **BC Cancer Research Institute** in **Vancouver, Canada**, our mission is global - collaborating with clinicians, scientists, and communities around the world to ensure that innovations in detection and care are accessible to all.
