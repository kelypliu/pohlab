The Poh Lab is dedicated to earlier detection and better risk prediction for oral cancer and precancers - so patients can get the right care at the right time. 

We develop molecular and imaging tests (non-invasive and tissue-based) to support risk-based triage and clinical decision-making. We also study prognostic markers in oral cancer, including predictors of nodal disease. 

We pair risk stratification with intervention research - developing and testing strategies and clinical tools to prevent progression of high-risk lesions and reduce the burden of oral cancer.
